## Examples

### Basic

This example should cover 95% of use cases.

If you use `npm ci` or `yarn --frozen-lockfile` on CI to install NPM dependencies - this Action is for you. Simply use it, and your NPM modules will be installed and the folder `~/.npm` or `~/.cache/yarn` will be cached. Typical use:

```yml
name: main
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
      - run: npm t
```

See [bahmutov/npm-install-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-action-example) ![npm-install-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-action-example/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=master).

### Subfolders

If your repository contains packages in separate folders, install each one separately

```text
repo/
  app1/
    package-lock.json
  app2/
    yarn.json
```

```yml
name: main
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
        with:
          working-directory: app1
      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
        with:
          working-directory: app2

      - name: App1 tests
        run: npm t
        working-directory: app1
      - name: Run app2
        run: node .
        working-directory: app2
```

See [npm-install-monorepo-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-monorepo-example) ![npm-install-monorepo-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-monorepo-example/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=master).

You can also specify multiple subfolders in a single action; one subfolder per line.

```yml
name: main
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
        with:
          working-directory: |
            app1
            app2
```

### Use lock file

By default, this action will use a lock file like `package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or `yarn.lock`. You can set `useLockFile: false` to use just `package.json` which might be better for [building libraries](https://twitter.com/mikeal/status/1202298796274700288).

```yml
- uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
  with:
    useLockFile: false
```

### Use time-based rolling cache

By default, yarn and npm dependencies will be cached according to the exact hash of the lockfile (if enabled) or the `package.json`. This will cause cache misses when the dependencies change, which can be slower than re-installing for big projects. To re-use the cache across runs with different lockfiles/dependencies, you can enable the `useRollingCache` option, which will restore the cache from more keys. It will expire the cache once a month to keep it from growing too large, see the Cache Snowballing & Rolling Cache expiry below.

```yml
- uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
  with:
    useRollingCache: true
```

`useRollingCache` is defaulted to false.

### Production dependencies

You can install just the production dependencies (without installing dev dependencies) by setting an environment variable `NODE_ENV` variable

```yml
- uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
  env:
    NODE_ENV: production
```

### Custom install command

You can use your own install command

```yml
- uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
  with:
    install-command: yarn --frozen-lockfile --silent
```

See [example-install-command.yml](./.github/workflows/example-install-command.yml)

### Add cache prefix

If you are installing different individual tools, you might want to have different caches. You can insert custom cache prefix strings into the cache keys. For example, let's install two different tools, each cache will be separate.

```yml
- name: Install tool A
  uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
  with:
    # use just package.json checksum
    useLockFile: false
    install-command: 'npm install tool-a'
    cache-key-prefix: tool-a

- name: Install tool B
  uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
  with:
    # use just package.json checksum
    useLockFile: false
    install-command: 'npm install tool-b'
    cache-key-prefix: tool-b
```

The first cache will have key `npm-tool-a-...` and the second cache will have key `npm-tool-b-...`

### Node version

If you need to use a specific Node version, use the [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) before installing the dependencies.

```yml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  # pick the Node version to use and install it
  # https://github.com/actions/setup-node
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: 20
  - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
```

See [example-node-version.yml](./.github/workflows/example-node-version.yml)

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## NPM

If you are writing your own GitHub Action and would like to use this action as a utility function, import it and run it.

```js
const { npmInstallAction } = require('npm-install')
await npmInstallAction()
```

## Debugging

You can see verbose messages from GitHub Actions by setting the following secrets (from [Debugging Actions Guide](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-debugging.md#step-debug-logs))

```
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

**Tip:** environment variable `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` enables debug messages from this action itself, try it first.

## Testing

Using Mocha and Sinon.js following the guide [How to set up Mocha with Sinon.js](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/mocha-and-sinon/). You can find the tests in [test](test) folder. In general:

- all environment inputs are done inside the action, so they can be stubbed and controlled during tests
- there are separate workflows in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) that match examples. Each workflow uses this action to install dependencies

## Cache Snowballing & Rolling Cache expiry

By default, this action will cache dependencies using an exacty hashs of the lock file (like `package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or `yarn.lock`). If you change any dependencies, there will be a cache miss. This is the default cache key strategy to avoid unbounded growth of the cache, as if you don't expire the cache, it will continue being added to. See [this post](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/do-not-let-npm-cache-snowball/) for more details on this issue.

To get better cache hit rates without the cache size snowballing, you can turn on this action's `useRollingCache` option, which will allow old caches to be re-used when your dependencies change, at the expense of some snowballing. Instead of letting the cache grow forever, this action resets it every month by including the current month in the cache key.

The rule of thumb is this: if re-installing your dependencies doesn't take very long, you can avoid superfluous cache restores by keeping `useRollingCache` off. This is the recommended setup for small projects. For big projects where installing the dependencies takes a long time, and cache restores are faster, `useRollingCache` will provide a performance improvement.
